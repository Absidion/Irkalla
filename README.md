Greetings! If you're reading this, you've stumbled onto the Github that contains the scripts, shaders and code created by The Negative for our project called Irkalla.

Who is The Negative?
We were a 7-man team of college students in a game development program. For our third and final year, we were put into a team to create something for our now remaining 7-8 months of school. 

What is Irkalla?
Irkalla is a First-Person Perspective Rogue-Like featuring Artifical Intelligence, Networking and Procedural Generation.
It's a co-op game and we intended for it to have two players join together to share in a similar experience without one person being the Lead and the other being just a side kick.

Used for this project was Photon Unity Networking from Exit Games. This was to handle our netcode instead of using UNet.

You'll only find code for this project in this repo. Art Assets were not uploaded.
